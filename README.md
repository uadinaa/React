# My React Learning Journey

This repository represents my learning path in **React and modern frontend development**.  
It contains homework assignments, labs, and small projects completed during my university course, showing my progression from basic React concepts to more advanced topics such as state management, routing, APIs, and PWAs.

The repository is structured to clearly reflect my growth and understanding of frontend development over time.
